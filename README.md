Top down 3D point and click adventure game

ESCAPE is a 3D point and click adventure game focussed on exploring the different sections of the world. The primary goal of the game is to collect the colored key from each section of the map so that the player can open the primary door exiting the map and winning the game. While searching for the keys players must unlock other doors and avoid obstacles to explore the entire map. Obstacles include spikes and enemies that chase the player around the map. The player can navigate using traditional point and click movement.
